<h2>Features</h2>

* Very simple application, where users can order one or more pizzas from a menu.
* Requires no user accounts and no login: users just input their names before using the app
* The pizza menu can change, so it should be loaded from an API
* Users can add multiple pizzas to a cart before ordering
* Ordering requires just the user's name, phone number, and address
* If possible, GPS location should also be provided, to make delivery easier
* User's can mark their order as "priority" for an additional 20% of the cart price
* Orders are made by sending a POST request with the order data (user data + selected pizzas) to the API
* Payments are made on delivery, so no payment processing is necessary in the app
* Each order will get a unique ID that should be displayed, so the user can later look up their order based on the ID
* Users should be able to mark their order as "priority" order even after it has been placed
